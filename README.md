# Pharmacovigilance Signal Detection Agent

AI Agent for Early Detection of Drug Safety Signals in Healthcare

##  Problem Statement

Pharmacovigilance teams continuously monitor *Adverse Event (AE)* reports to detect potential drug safety risks.  
Manual analysis of these reports is slow, reactive, and struggles to identify *early emerging safety signals* across large volumes of unstructured data.

Traditional pharmacovigilance systems often rely on static rules or delayed statistical reviews, which can miss early warning signs and increase patient risk.

## Problem Description

Pharmacovigilance is the process of monitoring drug safety by analyzing Adverse Event (AE) reports submitted by patients, healthcare professionals, and regulatory bodies. These reports often contain unstructured textual descriptions and arrive in very large volumes.

Manual analysis of such data is time-consuming, reactive, and prone to missing early warning safety signals, especially when patterns emerge gradually across multiple reports. Traditional systems mainly rely on static rules or delayed statistical analysis, which limits their ability to detect new or rare adverse reactions at an early stage.

There is a critical need for an intelligent, automated system that can analyze adverse event data, identify emerging risk patterns, and provide explainable insights to support timely decision-making and improve patient safety.

**Objective:** 

Build an AI-powered Pharmacovigilance Agent that:

- Analyzes adverse event reports
- Detects emerging safety signals  
- Clusters similar adverse events  
- Ranks risks by severity and frequency  
- Generates weekly safety signal summaries using Generative AI  

This system helps safety teams **act early and reduce patient risk**.

##  Proposed Solution

We propose an *AI-powered Pharmacovigilance Signal Detection Agent* that combines:

- *Machine Learning* for pattern detection  
- *Agentic reasoning* for autonomous decision-making  
- *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)* for grounded explanations  
- *Large Language Models (LLMs)* for human-readable safety summaries

## System Workflow

The overall workflow of the Pharmacovigilance Agent is as follows:

**1. Data Ingestion**
Adverse event reports are loaded from CSV datasets containing drug names, reactions, and severity.

**2. Data Preprocessing**
Missing or inconsistent records are cleaned to ensure data quality.

**3. Text Embedding Generation**
AE narratives are converted into numerical vectors using pretrained language models.

**4. Clustering**
Similar adverse events are grouped using unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

**5. Signal Detection**
Each cluster is analyzed for frequency, severity, and trend to compute a signal score.

**6. Agentic Decision-Making**
The agent prioritizes high-risk clusters based on computed scores.

**7. LLM-Based Explanation**
Selected signals are summarized into clear, human-readable safety insights.

**8. Report Generation**
Weekly safety signal reports are produced in structured and textual formats.

## Feasibility

The proposed Pharmacovigilance Signal Detection Agent is highly feasible within a hackathon environment due to the following reasons:

- Uses publicly available adverse event datasets (FAERS samples / synthetic data)

- Relies on pretrained ML and NLP models, avoiding time-consuming training

- Modular Python-based architecture allows rapid development and testing

- Can be implemented without a UI, focusing on backend intelligence as per guidelines

- Scales easily from small sample datasets to real-world FAERS data

The system is designed to work effectively even with limited computational resources, making it practical for short-duration development and demonstrations.

## Reliability

The system ensures reliability through a combination of statistical validation, ML robustness, and explainability:

- Text embeddings capture semantic similarity between adverse events

- Clustering algorithms group related events consistently

- Rule-based signal scoring adds transparency and interpretability

- Deterministic outputs for the same input ensure reproducibility

- LLM-generated summaries are grounded in detected clusters and metrics

- Together, these measures reduce false positives and ensure trustworthy safety signal identification.
