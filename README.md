# Pharmacovigilance Signal Detection Agent

AI Agent for Early Detection of Drug Safety Signals in Healthcare

## 1. Problem Statement

Pharmacovigilance teams are responsible for monitoring adverse drug reaction reports to identify potential safety risks.  
These reports are large in volume, unstructured, and continuously increasing.  

Currently, safety analysts manually review adverse event reports to detect emerging drug safety signals. This process is:

- Time-consuming  
- Reactive instead of proactive  
- Prone to missing early warning patterns  
- Difficult to scale across millions of reports  

There is a strong need for an intelligent, automated system that can analyze adverse event data, detect early safety signals, and generate explainable insights to support faster and safer decision-making.

**Objective:**  
Build an AI-powered Pharmacovigilance Agent that:

- Analyzes adverse event reports
- Detects emerging safety signals  
- Clusters similar adverse events  
- Ranks risks by severity and frequency  
- Generates weekly safety signal summaries using Generative AI  

This system helps safety teams **act early and reduce patient risk**.
