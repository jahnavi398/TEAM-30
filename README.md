# Pharmacovigilance Signal Detection Agent

AI Agent for Early Detection of Drug Safety Signals in Healthcare

##  Problem Statement

Pharmacovigilance teams continuously monitor *Adverse Event (AE)* reports to detect potential drug safety risks.  
Manual analysis of these reports is slow, reactive, and struggles to identify *early emerging safety signals* across large volumes of unstructured data.

Traditional pharmacovigilance systems often rely on static rules or delayed statistical reviews, which can miss early warning signs and increase patient risk.

## Problem Description

Pharmacovigilance is the process of monitoring drug safety by analyzing Adverse Event (AE) reports submitted by patients, healthcare professionals, and regulatory bodies. These reports often contain unstructured textual descriptions and arrive in very large volumes.

Manual analysis of such data is time-consuming, reactive, and prone to missing early warning safety signals, especially when patterns emerge gradually across multiple reports. Traditional systems mainly rely on static rules or delayed statistical analysis, which limits their ability to detect new or rare adverse reactions at an early stage.

There is a critical need for an intelligent, automated system that can analyze adverse event data, identify emerging risk patterns, and provide explainable insights to support timely decision-making and improve patient safety.

**Objective:** 

Build an AI-powered Pharmacovigilance Agent that:

- Analyzes adverse event reports
- Detects emerging safety signals  
- Clusters similar adverse events  
- Ranks risks by severity and frequency  
- Generates weekly safety signal summaries using Generative AI  

This system helps safety teams **act early and reduce patient risk**.

##  Proposed Solution

We propose an *AI-powered Pharmacovigilance Signal Detection Agent* that combines:

- *Machine Learning* for pattern detection  
- *Agentic reasoning* for autonomous decision-making  
- *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)* for grounded explanations  
- *Large Language Models (LLMs)* for human-readable safety summaries
